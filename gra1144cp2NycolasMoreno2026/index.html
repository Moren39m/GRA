			<h2> Ajiaco Recipe</h2>
				<p> Colombian Ajiaco is one of the most traditional soups; its origins can be traced to pre-hispanic and colonial traditions. Ajiaco is a chicken soup full of rich flavors, where color, texture, and Creole ingredients add to its complexity as a traditional dish. There are different versions of Ajiaco, but in these variations, the soup always contains Chicken, three kinds of potatoes, corn, and a herb name guascas as its main pillars. This soup is most commonly prepared in the mountain regions of the country and served in a clay pot. This recipe will focus on the most popular version: the Bogotano Ajiaco or Santafere&ntilde;o.</p>
